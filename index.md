<h3 class="title is-3">What is Place2Be?</h3>
<div class="post-content">
  <p>Place2Be is a product that makes building and scaling Gamified Loyalty Programs as easy as it should be.</p>
  <p>The application is two sided, an online interface to create the Gamification Schemes (GUI) and a websocket API for the media (apps, websites, ...) to interact in realtime.</p>
  <p>The funny thing is that creating and updating Schemes don't require programming skills and is instantly updated to 100% of your interacting clients. :-)</p>

<h3 class="title is-3">What is a Gamification Scheme?</h3>
<div class="post-content">
  <p>A Gamification Scheme is defined as a collection of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/place2be_in_practice/activables">Activables</a> (linked or not to each other) that Players can activate and/or unlock.</p>

  <p>You define the scheme, Players tries to progress accross it, and Place2Be computes the mechanics in between.</p>
