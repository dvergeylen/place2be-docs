<h3 class="title is-3">What is Place2Be?</h3>
<p>Place2Be is a product that makes building and scaling Gamified Loyalty Programs as easy as it should be.</p>
<p>The application is two sided, an online interface to create the Gamification Schemes (GUI) and a websocket API for the media (apps, websites, ...) to interact in realtime.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that creating and updating Schemes don't require programming skills and is instantly updated to 100% of your interacting clients. :-)</p>
